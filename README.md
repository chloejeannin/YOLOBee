## Workflows
To train the neural network for recognizing bees, some steps need to be follow.
### Data Preparation
To begin, for the neural network to learn, you need to have a dataset with some pictures of the bees. Starting from a video, you need to cut some frames to select about 30 frames. The best dataset will be composed of different frames with bees buzzing in the flowers or bees flying. It will enable the algorithm to recognize a bee in any conditions. 

So for getting the frames, you can use the notebook called cut_frames, which will pick some of the frames inside the video you have enter in input. You can change the number of frames you want to have inside the algorithm but the default one will pick for you 30 frames. 

Then, you need to annotate them. Indeed, to learn, the neural network needs to know what is a bee. For this step you can use the software named makesense.ai. This can allow you to annotate you frames in a really easy way.
