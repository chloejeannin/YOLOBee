### Training 05
This different trainings were created to compare the results of the different sizes of neural networks. YOLOv5s is a small neural network because it has fewer parameters (7.2 M) and FLOPs (16.5 B) compared to the medium size (21.2 M and 49 B) and the large neural network (86.7 M and 205.7 B). The small network is also less fast than the two other networks.

The different training 05 were not made on Google Coolab but on the metacentrum. This means that they can not be launched from Google Colab because the paths are not correct. Only the Augmentations were made on Google Collab. There was a necessity to go from Google Collab to Metacentrum because the GPUs on Google Collab were never available.
